Notes & Caveats
---------------

### Transform and CornerPin produce aliasing when scaling down images

The transform nodes may produce aliasing artifacts when downscaling by a factor of 2 or more.

This can be avoided by blurring (using BlurCImg) or resizing (using ResizeOIIO) the image before downscaling it.

There are several solutions to this problem, which may be implemented in the future (you can help!):

* Trilinear mipmapping (as implemented by OpenGL) still produces artifacts when scaling is anisotropic (i.e. the scaling factor is different along two directions)
* [Feline (McCormack, 1999)](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/WRL-99-1.pdf), which is close to what is proposed in [OpenGL's anisotropic texture filter](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/texture_filter_anisotropic.txt) is probably 4-5 times slower than mipmapping, but produces less artifacts
* [EWA (Heckbert 1989)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/texfund/texfund.pdf) would give the highest quality, but is probably 20 times slower than mipmapping.

A sample implementation of the three methods is given in [Mesa 3D](http://mesa3d.org/)'s [software rasterizer, src/mesa/swrast/s_texfilter.c](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/mesa/swrast/s_texfilter.c).

### What does the Roto plugin do?

If you use the Roto plugin in any other host than [Natron](http://natron.inria.fr), you will notice that it doesn't do much. Its role is just to provide an entry point for a host-based rotoscoping tool, which provides a roto mask to this plugin.

### ColorLookup does not work on Nuke 8/9, DaVinci Resolve...

Although Nuke 8 & 9 claim via OpenFX that they support parametric parameters (i.e. adjustable parametric curves), these don't work (at least on OS X, and maybe on other platforms). The plugin appears in the plugin list, but cannot be instanciated. Nothing seems to happen, and the following message appears on the console (on OS X):

    Exception thrown
      basic_string::_S_construct NULL not valid

The same happens with other plugins using parametric parameters, such as [TuttleHistogramKeyer](http://www.tuttleofx.org/).

Parametric parameters work in older versions of Nuke (at least in Nuke 6 & 7).

DaVinci Resolve does not support parametric parameters.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/devernay/openfx-misc/issues) if you think openfx-misc is doing something wrong, or you know of other hosts which have problems with parametric paremeters.

Although ColorCorrect uses parametric parameters, it can still be instanciated on Nuke 8 & 9 and on DaVinci Resolve, but the curve ranges are not adjustable (shadows are decreasing linearly from 0 to 0.09, and highlights are increasing linearly from 0.5 to 1.0).

Installation
------------

These plugins are included in the binary distributions of [Natron](http://natron.inria.fr).

If you want to compile the plugins from source, you may either use the
provided Unix Makefile, the Xcode project, or the Visual Studio project.

### Getting the sources from github

To fetch the latest sources from github, execute the following commands:

	git clone https://github.com/devernay/openfx-misc.git
	cd openfx-misc
	git submodule update -i -r

In order to get a specific tag, corresponding to a source release, do `git tag -l`
to get the list of tags, and then `git checkout tags/<tag_name>`
to checkout a given tag.

### Unix/Linux/FreeBSD/OS X, using Makefiles

On Unix-like systems, the plugins can be compiled by typing in a
terminal:
- `make [options]` to compile as a single combined plugin (see below
  for valid options).
- `make nomulti [options]` to compile as separate plugins (useful if
only a few plugins are is needed, for example). `make` can also be
executed in any plugin's directory.

The most common options are `CONFIG=release` to compile a release
version, `CONFIG=debug` to compile a debug version. Or
`CONFIG=relwithdebinfo` to compile an optimized version with debugging
symbols.

Another common option is `BITS=32`for compiling a 32-bits version,
`BITS=64` for a 64-bits version, and `BITS=Universal` for a universal
binary (OS X only).

See the file `Makefile.master`in the toplevel directory for other useful
flags/variables.

The compiled plugins are placed in subdirectories named after the
configuration, for example Linux-64-realease for a 64-bits Linux
compilation. In each of these directories, a `*.bundle` directory is
created, which has to be moved to the proper place
(`/usr/OFX/Plugins`on Linux, or `/Library/OFX/Plugins`on OS X), using
a command like the following, with the *same* options used for
compiling:

	sudo make install [options]

### OS X, using Xcode

The latest version of Xcode should be installed in order to compile this plugin.

Open the "Terminal" application (use spotlight, or browse `/Applications/Utilities`), and paste the following lines one-by-one (an administrator password will be asked for after the second line):

	xcodebuild -configuration Release install
	sudo mkdir /Library/OFX/Plugins
	sudo mv /tmp/Misc.dst/Library/OFX/Plugins/Misc /Library/OFX/Plugins

The plugins may also be compiled by compiling the Xcode project called
`Misc.xcodeproj` in the toplevel directory. The bundles produced by
this project have to be moved to `/Library/OFX/Plugins`.

### MS Windows, using Visual Studio

Compile using the provided `Misc.vcxproj`project found in the `Misc`
directory.

32-bits plugins should be installed in the directory `c:\Program Files
(x86)\Common Files\OFX\Plugin`, 64-bits plugins should be installed in
`c:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins`.
